  - Abstract: 
    - Quantum sampling and Ising partition function evaluation are physically relevant computational tasks which are often analytically intractable. We explore the links between these tasks, and measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs).  We prove that these tasks are equivalent, and their computational complexity undergoes a transition mappable to a novel MIPT. This MIPT is exhibited in boundary states induced by measuring the bulk of cluster states in different configurations. We characterize this MIPT by analogy to chaotic circuits with weak measurements, thereby establishing the regimes and origins of these tasksâ€™ complexity. We provide an efficient algorithm for these tasks in the easy-to-simulate phase.
