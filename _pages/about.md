We are a community of motivated young physicists of Chinese origin in the greater Boston area. Our group comprises of undergraduate, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows from Boston College, Boston University, Brandeis, Harvard, MIT, Northeastern, and Tufts University. We convene regularly to engage in seminars and other enjoyable activities, aimed at sharing knowledge, exchanging ideas, fostering innovation and creativity, and building social connections. Our gatherings also offer opportunities for leisure and recreation, such as playing games like Werewolf.

You may check the tentative schedule for Spring 2023 [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JMghsoa93FFSqsloE4z_SP1rIs2ugggSCiP-hldbLe8/edit?usp=sharing). If you would like to give a talk about your research, please contact us.
