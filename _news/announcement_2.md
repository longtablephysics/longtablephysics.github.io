- Upcoming general topic seminar:
  - **Title: Magic in the Frontiers of Quantum Science (2/17)**
  - by *Kaifeng Bu*
  - Palfrey House, 18 Hammond St, Cambridge, 7:00 PM
  - Abstract: Quantum computation is expected to outperform classical computation, yet understanding the origins of this advantage remains a fundamental challenge. In this talk, I will focus on the quantum feature, called magic, which can support the quantum advantage. I will introduce a quantum convolution to test and measure magic. I will also introduce a coarse-graining map, called the “convolution group”, to perform the classification of many-body states. Finally, I will discuss the possible future directions in this framework.
